# ToDo

1. More complex password and username requirements.
2. Add email to users/email verification
3. ExerciseType stuff might need to be thought out more:
    * no custom exercise types for now
4. Logs
    * How to keep track of order of exercises/setgroups
        * Maybe keep workout id and delete/redo everything every time a workout is modified
6. Make graceful shutdown a little less verbose in main
