# ToDo

1. Backend for workout template CRUDs
2. More complex password and username requirements.
3. Add email to users/email verification

4. ExerciseType stuff might need to be thought out more:
    * no custom exercise types for now

5. Logs
    * How to keep track of order of exercises/setgroups
        * Maybe keep workout id and delete/redo everything every time a workout is modified

6. SET UP FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS
